# Jallox Portfolio
Here you can find my portfolio built with Astro 5 and Tailwind CSS. Here you'll find from my github repos, to some of my (pending) SaaS that I'll develop.

Feel free to make changes to this repo, but only to make it better!

## Tech Stack
This website was built using Astro 5, TailwindCSS and Flowbite UI for a faster development.

If you want to run it locally you can
1. Clone the repo
2. Run `npm install` (`pnpm` recommended)
3. Run Astro dev server with `npm run dev` (`pnpm run dev`)
4. Visit `http://localhost:4321/` in your web browser!
